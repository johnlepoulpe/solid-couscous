\addcontentsline{toc}{section}{\protect\numberline{}Introduction}%

The MOSAIC team develops mathematical models and tools to study the
morphogenesis and growth of animals and plants. Thus, they design
mathematical models and data structures able to describe efficiently
and accurately the shapes and properties of the plants or animals.

For example, it is natural to represent the structure and
ramifications of a plant by a tree. Furthermore, we can observe some
ramifications patterns tend to repeat themselves in many places of the
plants. The MOSAIC team has thus designed a theoretical model of the
structure of a plant based on this idea of repeated patterns:
self-nested trees, trees in which all the subtrees of equal height are
isomorphic.

Depending on the species, the size of these trees can be tremendous
and lead to unreasonable computing time. They also developed a
compression algorithm for trees, based on the same idea of patterns
within the tree, by eliminating this redundancy. Moreover, by
eliminating this redundancy, the global behavior of the tree is
highlighted. Thus, this compression helps to understand the structure
of the plant and its developement. 

Those compression algorithms return DAGs (Directed Acyclic Graph) and
it is possible to show that the tree having the best compression
factor are the self-nested ones. Therefore, it is interessant to
approximate trees by self-nested ones, in order to have an approximate
yet compact representation of them. There are several ways to do this
and the MOSAIC team has developed different algorithms doing
this. However, the approximation given by those algorithms are not the
best (either because these algorithms are heuristics or because some
additional conditions are imposed on the self nested trees returned by
the algorithm). In fact no efficient algorithm has been found to
compute the nearest self-nested tree to a tree. 

Therefore the goal of this internship is to prove that this problem is
NP-complete. Under the assumption that the P and NP complexity classes are
different, this would prove there exists no polynomial algorithm able
to find the nearest self-nested tree to a tree in general, and thereby
legitimate the algorithms previously developed by the team.

The state of the art, along with definitions and notations will be
presented and introduced in a first section. We will then give further
details on the NP-complete theory and present the results found during
the intership. Finally, we will explain how this results consist in a
improvement of the state of the art and the consequences and applications.
