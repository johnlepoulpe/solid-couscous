\section*{Acknowledgments}

I would like to thank Christophe Godin for the time he spent
supervising and helping me, as well as him and Romain Azais for the
many discussions we had together about NP-completeness and Self-nestd
trees. I also would like to thank Frédéric Vivien, who helped me to
work on the first approach and gave me numerous advices on the way of
approaching a problem of NP-completness.
