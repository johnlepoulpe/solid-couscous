\section{Contribution}

We assume that the reader is familiar with the complexity theory. In
this article, we will denote the set of instances by $\Omega$ and the
set of positive instances by $Y$. See the appendix for further
reminder on the complexity theory.

\subsection{Belonging to the NP class}

We aim to prove that the NST decision problem is NP-complete. It
clearly belongs to the NP class. Indeed, for all tree $T = (V,E)$, for
all integer $k$, given a potential solution $S$, it is possible to
ascertain whether or not $S$ is self-nested, and to compute the
distance between $S$ and $T$ also in polynomial time.

\subsection{First approach}
To help us build the reduction, a few conceptual remarks can be made,
in order to guide the research. First of all, the reduction has no
obligation to be surjective; as a matter of fact, it is quite often
not surjective. The image of the reduction has to be small enough to know the
general form of the solution of each instance in order to be able to
prove the equivalence
$\omega_{A} \in Y_{A} \Leftrightarrow \omega_{b} = f(\omega_{a}) \in Y_{B}$ (where
$A$ is the initial NP-complete problem and $B$ is the problem we
consider). Yet, if the image of $\Omega_{A}$ by the reduction has to
be big enough so that we are unable to find a polynomial algorithm
solving the problem on the set of images of the reduction. Indeed,
finding such an algorithm and a reduction would mean we would have
solved the open question of the equality of the P and NP classes,
which is unreasonable.

In order to understand better the difficulty of the problem, I tried
to find a way to compute efficiently the NST in special cases. Indeed,
as long as we find a polynomial algorithm solving the NST problem on
the set of trees considered, we are ensured that the difficulty
leading to the NP-hardness lies somewhere else.

I first considered the trees of height 2. In the NEST and NeST
algorithms, C. Godin, P. Ferraro and R. Azais consider only edit
operations such as the height of any pre-existing node is unchanged
(see Figure \ref{fig:edit_height}). I decided to first use these edit
operations.
\begin{figure}
  \centering
  
  \caption{edit operation height conservation}
  \label{fig:edit_height}
\end{figure}

\subsubsection{Trees of height 2 with same height} 
Let $T$ be a tree of height 2 (see Figure \ref{fig:height2}). We can
first notice that if there are any leaves of depth 1, they do not
require any edit operations to obtain $NST(T)$. We can for this reason
assume that every node of depth 1 is of height 1.

\begin{figure}
  \centering
  
  \caption{example of tree of height 2}
  \label{fig:height2}
\end{figure}

Let us denote $NST(T)$ by $S$ and an optimal edit mapping between $T$
and $S$ by $\Phi$. We will show in this section that it is possible to
find Phi in polynomial time.

Let us denote the nodes of height 1 of $T$ by
$(u_{i})_{1 \leqslant i \leqslant N}$ and
$(n_{i})_{1 \leqslant i \leqslant N}$ their number of children. We
will suppose that the sequence $(n_{i})_{1 \leqslant i \leqslant N}$ is
sorted by ascending order. Each $u_{i}$ can be either
deleted or mapped on a node of height 1 of $S$, and since $S$ is
self-nested all the nodes of height 1 in $S$ are isomorphic to one
another. The complete subtree under the each node of height 1 of $S$
is characterized by its number of leaves. As a result, the edit
mapping leading from $T$ to $S$ is characterized by the $I_{0}$ the
set of index of the nodes deleted and by $\tilde{n}$ the number of
leaves under a node of height 1 in $S$. Thus, we will try to find
$I_{0}$ and $\tilde{n}$ such as the corresponding self nested tree is
a minimal distance from $T$.

To delete $u_{i}$, in order to respect the constraint of Zhang, we
have to delete first all of his children execept one. Therefore,
deleting $u_{i}$ costs $n_{i}$ where $n_{i}$ is the number of children
of $u_{i}$.

If $u_{i}$ is not deleted, than we have to adjust the number of
children it has to $\tilde{n}$, which costs
$\left|n_{i} - \tilde{n}\right|$. As a result, $u_{i}$ has to be
deleted if and only if $n_{i}$ is closer to 0 than to
$\tilde{n}$. Figure \ref{fig:optimalcost} shows $f_{i}$ the minimum
cost for each $u_{î}$ in function of $\tilde{n}$.

\begin{figure}
  \centering
  \caption{optimal cost for $u_{i}$ in function of $\tilde{n}$}
  \label{fig:optimalcost}
\end{figure}

By summing the functions on every $u_{i}$, we obtain $f$ the minimal cost
of a mapping leading from $T$ to a self nested tree of height 2, with
$N$ nodes of depth 1, in function of $\tilde{n}$ the number of
children of the nodes of height 1. We can observe that the resulting
function is a piecewise linear function and every differentiable break
has for abscissa one of the $n_{i}$ or $2*n_{i}$. Therefore, the
minimum of this function is reached in one of those points. Since
$f_{i}$ is increasing before $2*n_{i}$ and constant after and that the
derivative of the other $f_{j}$ are equal before and after $2*n_{i}$,
$2*n_{i}$ cannot be a minimum of $f$.

Thus, by evaluating $f$ on every $n_{i}$, it is possible to find the
minimum of $f$ and thereby find the NST of $T$.

\begin{remark}
  We will denote by
  ${I_{0} = \{i \in \llbracket 1;N \rrbracket \ | \ u_{i} \text{ is
      deleted} \}}$ and ${I_{1} = \{i \in \llbracket 1;N \rrbracket \
    | \ 
    \Phi(u_{i}) \text{ is of height } 1 \}}$.\\
  For every $i \in I_{0}$, for every $j \in I_{1}$, $n_{i} < n_{j}$

\end{remark}

probleme: c'est polynomial -> pas assez compliqué!
Sans la contrainte de hauteur ?

\subsubsection{Trees of height 2 without the heigth constraint}
We will use the same notations as in the preceding paragraph. We will
denote by $I_{k}$ the set ${\{i \in \llbracket 1;N \rrbracket \ | \ 
\Phi(u_{i}) \text{ is of height } k \}}$. 

Intuition:\\
Idée 1: Plusieurs types de noeud: ceux ou on supprime les fils, ceux
qui augmente de hauteur jusqu'a $k$.

Idée 2: L'arbre auto-emboité à minimal n'est défini que par les
$I_{k}$ et les $\tilde{n}^{k}$.

Idée 3:
Formule du coup de la distance à l'arbre + explication. 
Moins un noeud de profondeur 1 a de fils, plus il est
interessant de les supprimer au lieu de l'égaliser aves les autres.\\

Lemmes: On prouve que les $\tilde{n}^k$ croissent de manière
exponentielle. On reparque que les $|I_{k}|$ décroissent de manière exponentielle.\\ 

Let us denote by $\tilde{n}^{k}$ the number of children of the nodes
of height $k$ in $S$. We can use the same remark as the one made in the
previous paragraph and show that the $\{n_{i} | i \in I_{k} \}$ are
disjoint and that if $k < l$

\subsection{deuxieme approche}
We can see some general patterns in many differents proofs of
NP-completeness. In this section we will present the idea of \widgets
and of \constraints, through two different reductions.

Let us begin with the proof of the reduction from 3-SAT to INDEP-SET
\cite{polytech}. As a brief reminder:

\begin{definition}[3-SAT]
\textsc{Input:} $\Phi$ a formula in conjonctive normal form where each
clause is composed of three litterals. \\
\textsc{Output:} Yes if and only if there exists an interpretation
that satifies $\Phi$.\\
\end{definition}

\begin{definition}[INDEP-SET] 
\textsc{Input:} $G=(V,E)$ an undirected graph and $k$ an integer.\\
\textsc{Output:} Yes if and only if there exists a set of vertices
$V' \subset V$ of size $k$ such that for every pair of vertices
$(u,v)$ of $V'$, $(u,v) \notin E$.\\
\end{definition}

\begin{figure}
  \centering
  
  \caption{reduction 3-SAT to INDEP-SET}
  \label{fig:indep-set}
\end{figure}

In the reduction proposed by Garey and Johnson \cite{garey}, the image
instance of INDEP-SET is built in two steps: the first one consists in
defining triangles that correspond to each clause of the initial
instance of 3-SAT (see Figure \ref{fig:3sat}); the second one consists
in adding edges that link the nodes of the \widgets that are labeled
with the negation of the same variable of 3-SAT. One way of
interpreting this division in two steps is to consider the triangle
\widgets as \variables that can take three different values (the
\variable term here should not be confused with the variable of the
3-SAT problem) and to consider the edges linking the \widgets as
\constraints.

These three different possible values are the labels of the three
nodes of the triangle. The value taken is the label of the node that
belongs to the set of vertices of $V'$ the INDEP-SET problem. For
example, Figure \ref{fig:indep-set}, the first widget can take the
values $x$, $y$ or $z$.

The edges linking two \widgets $A$ and $B$ forbid the two coresponding
\variables to take simultaneously some given values. Indeed, we can
see Figure \ref{fig:indep-set} that the edge $(x, \neg x)$ between the
first and the second \widgets forbids the first \widget to take the
value $x$ if the second takes the value $\neg x$ at the same time.

We will now consider the reduction from VERTEX-COVER to
HAMILTONIAN-PATH proposed by Cormen, Leiserson, Rivest and Stein
\cite{cormen}. As a reminder:

\begin{definition}[VERTEX-COVER]
  \textsc{Input:} $G=(V,E)$ a undirected graph and $k$ an integer. \\
  \textsc{Output:} Yes if and only if there exists set ofvertices $V'
  \subset V$ of size $k$ such that for every edge $(u,v) \in E$, $u
  \in V'$ or $v \in V'$.\\
\end{definition}

\begin{definition}[HAMILTONIAN-CYCLE] 
  \textsc{Input:} $G=(V,E)$ an undirected graph.\\
  \textsc{Output:} Yes if and only if $G$ is hamiltonian, in other
  words, if there exists a cycle on $G$ visiting every vertex one and
  only one time.\\
\end{definition}

\begin{figure}
  \centering
  
  \caption{reduction 3-SAT to INDEP-SET}
  \label{fig:indep-set}
\end{figure}

In this reduction, the image instance is also built in two steps: the
first one consist in defining small pieces of graph composed of twelve
nodes (Figure \ref{fig:hamilton}), and the second one consists in
linking this pieces together through additionnal edges and
vertices. 

Once again, the small \widgets of the first part can be interpreted as
variables. Indeed, there are two and only two ways of visiting one
\widget during the traversal of the complete graph: in one time or two
times. For this reason, the \widget can be seen as a \variable that
can take two values, one or two.

The edges and vertices added to connect the \widgets together can
likewise be seen as \constraints.

\begin{figure}
  \centering
  
  \caption{Hamiltonian widget}
  \label{fig:hamilton}
\end{figure}

In both cases, several remarks can be made: first of all, without the
\constraints, the \widgets are totally independant: the value taken by
one of them has no influence on any of the values taken by the
others. Secondly, the \constraints highly reflects the shape of
the instance of the first problem. Finally, the \widget used in the
reduction is specific to the second problem.

I choose to start the reduction from the INDEP-SET problem because
of its simplicity and of the clarity of its \constraints and
\variables. Indeed, each vertex of the graph can be considered as
a binary \variable taking the value 1 if the vertex belongs to $V'$
and 0 otherwise. There are to types of \constraints, the first one is
that only $k$ variables can take the value 1, the second one is that
if there is an edge between thes vertices $x$ and $y$, the
corresponding \variables cannot take both the value 1.

I decided to find pieces of trees that could be easily combined
together and that could be the \widgets of the reduction we are trying
to find. These \widgets have to be used in only two possible ways, in
order to act as \variables. In our case, this means that there are two
and only two different self-nested trees at equal and minimal distance
from the \widget. Furthemore, they have to be easily combined and in a
way that the choice of use of each \widget is indepedent from the way
we use the others.

In order to be independant, the \widgets have to be placed at
different heights: indeed, if two \widgets are at the same height,
their variations will be the same to obtain the nearest self-nested
tree so they couldn't represent different \variables. A solution to
this problem is to search widgets through their DAG compression and to
pile them up. A second advantage of this method is that, the size of
the corresponding tree grows exponentionally, whereas the size of the
DAG grows linearly with the number of \widgets, so if we rephrase the
NST problem to give in \textsc{Input} a DAG instead of a tree, the
construction has still chances to be polynomial.

A piece of DAG that respects this properties is shown Figure
\ref{fig:widget}. The corresponding tree is at equal distance of the
self nested trees Figures \ref{fig:NSTwidget1} and
\ref{fig:NSTwidget2}, and their DAG compression is shown Figures
\ref{fig:DAGwidget1} and \ref{fig:DAGwidget2}. These \widgets can be
pilled up and used independently as shown Figure
\ref{fig:empilement}. 

We will denote the tree obtained by pilling up
$n$ \widgets by $T_{n}$. It is possible to show that $T_{n}$ is
equidistant from every tree having the DAG compression of Figure
\ref{fig:NSTempilement} where every $A_{i}$ is either the DAG piece
Figure \ref{fig:DAGwidget1} or Figure \ref{fig:DAGwidget2}. There
exists no tree closer to $T_{n}$ than these ones. %reference en annexe

\begin{figure}
  \centering
  
  \caption{Widget of the NST problem}
  \label{fig:widget}
\end{figure}

To summarize, we now have a tree $T_{n}$ which has exactly $2^{n}$
different NST and each one of this self nested trees corresponds to an
assignment of $n$ variables in $\{0;1\}$. As explained before, this
could correspond to the first step of a reduction of the NST
problem. In order to complete the reduction, we have to add
\constraints and to choose from which NP complete problem do the
reduction. Once an NP-complete problem $P$ is chosen, adding \constraints
means modifing $T_{n}$ in function of the instance of $P$, in
order to obtain a tree $T$ closer to the NST corresponding to a
valid assignment of \variables for the instance of $P$.




L'idée est alors de modifier légerment $T_{n}$, en fonction de
l'instance de départ afin de l'approcher davantage des arbres
representant une solution valide, ainsi que de ceux dont moins de $n$
variables ont été mis à une valeur positive.

les agencer

\subsection{Intuition guiding the researches}

\begin{itemize}
\item Approche 1: se familariser avec le problème en se restraignant à
  un sous-ensemble et montrer que déjà là c'est dur. Risque possible:
  se restraindre à un sous-ensemble où en fait, c'est polynomial. Ça
  permet quand même en général de mieux comprendre son problème.
\item Approche 2: Preuve de NP-complétude à base de \widget,
  i.e., de structures particulières que l'on peut combiner
  astucieusement pour exprimer les \constraint du problème
  auquel on cherche à se réduire.
\item Approche 3: Trouver un graphe qui paraisse particulièrement
  difficile.
\end{itemize}

In this section, I illustrate the second approach, where \widgets
are built and linked to each others through \constraints. 

Let us begin with the proof of the reduction from 3-SAT to INDEP-SET
\cite{polytech}. As a brief reminder:
\begin{definition}[3-SAT]
  
\end{definition}

\begin{definition}[INDEP-SET]
  
\end{definition}
\begin{figure}

  \centering
  
  \caption{3SAT reduction}
  \label{fig:3sat}
\end{figure}

%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
\noindent\hrulefill

In the reduction proposed by Garey and Johnson\cite{garey}, the image
instance of INDEP-SET is built in two steps: the first one consists in
defining triangles that correspond to each clause of the initial
instance of 3-SAT (see Figure\ref{fig:3sat}); the second one consists
in adding edges that link the nodes of the \widgets that are labeled
with the negation of the same variable of 3-SAT. One way of
interpreting this division in two steps is to consider the triangle
\widgets as \variables that can take three different values (the
\variable term here should not be confused with the variable of the
3-SAT problem). 

These three values are the label of three nodes of the
triangle, and the value taken by the variable is the label of the node
taken in the set of vertices of INDEP-SET.

The edges linking the nodes are representing
the constraints of the first problem

Furthermore, we can observe that generally, the construction of the
image instance seems to be combination of two different things: a part
that reflects only the number of variables in the instance of the
first problem and a part reflecting the links and constraints that
they have with one another.  For example, in the proof of the
reduction from 3-SAT to INDEP-SET \cite{polytech}, the first part
consists in the triangles corresponding to each clause of the initial
instance, and the second to the edges linking the nodes such as one is
labeled with the negation of the other. In the proof of the reduction
from VERTEX-COVER to HAMILTONIAN-CYCLE \cite{polytech}, the first part
consists in the 12 nodes widgets corresponding to each edge of the
initial graph, and the second part consists in the way they are linked
to one another to form the image graph.

We can also observe that in the first part, a piece of the image
instance corresponds to each variable of the initial
instance. Moreover, this piece of the image instance is very
restrictive and can be used in a solution only in a few (2 or 3 most
of the time) different ways. For example in the proof of the reduction
from VERTEX-COVER to HAMILTONIAN-CYCLE \cite{polytech}, the widgets
can either be visited in one pass or in two.

Furthermore the way these pieces are used is completely independant
until the second part corresponding to the constraints between the
variables is added.

\subsection{Trees of height 2 without variation of the height}
The edit distance with constraint of K.Zhang being slightly difficult
to manipulate, we will use a far more restrictive variant in this
section: only leaves (and not internal nodes) can be added or
deleted. More precisely, if $u$ is an ancestor of $v$ in $T$ and
$v \in V'_{1}$ then $u \in V'_{1}$.

In this section we present a polynomial algorithm computing the
nearest self-nested tree of height 2 to a tree of height 2.

\subsection{Trees of height 2 with variation of the height}
In this section, we present a polynomial algorithm computing the nearest
self-nested tree to a tree of height 2.

\subsection{Family of bricks}
In this section, we present a family of trees that could be used as
the first part of the reduction to represent the variables of the
initial instance.
